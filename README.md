# Blog-list-frontend
In this project I have created a blog-list app using React (in particular functional components and useState and useEffect hooks) where the user can read, add, edit and delete a list of his/her favourite articles.

Initially I'm connecting the app to a JSON Server to act as my server, but the next step will be to create a web server with node.js and connect it to this app.
